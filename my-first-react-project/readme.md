Project includes:

* Simple Routing (using react-dom) ;
* Simple data fetching from Fortnite(not a fan!) API and then displaying it ;
* Playing around and learning about state and props ;
* I obviously prefer functional components, but I can do them with class App extents React.Component ;
* ES6 Modules ;
* Imo best practises ;
